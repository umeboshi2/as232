Pay very close attention to the explict claims of copyright in this
repository, then use the evidence to make a determination.  If you
cannot make a determination, you don't need to use anything in this
repository.  However, if you still feel the need to make a determination,
and this evidence is insufficient, I charge $100 per hour (tendered legally
in either Federal Reserve Notes representing the weight of dollars, or properly
denominated gold, or silver coin) for my consulting services.  You are
encouraged to think for yourself, but you can pay me to think for you.


Sincerely,

Joseph Rawson
